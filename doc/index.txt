Test results
============

There are some automatically generated `test results`__ that
demonstrate the abilities of the system.  

It is not expected at this point that the output is entirely correct.
If you see a long URL displayed beginning with
``http://tempo.iti.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/``, that means the Guido
NoteServer choked on what was being sent to it.  The XML is extremely
hard to read at the moment because I haven't got around to
pretty-printing it yet.

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need a copy of `libxml2/libxslt`__ with Python bindings
installed.

.. __: http://www.libxml.org

Microsoft Windows
`````````````````

Stéphane Bidoul maintains installers of the `libxml2/libxslt Python
bindings`__.  That's by far the easiest way to get this going on
Windows.

.. __: http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/

Linux
`````

To see if the libxml2/libxslt Python bindings are already installed,
open a Python interpreter and type::

  import libxml

If you don't receive an error, you're good to go.

If not, there's a good chance your distribution provides a binary package.
For instance, on Fedora Core 1.0, the package is named
``libxml2-python``.  Try installing it using your
distribution-specific package installation tool (RPM, dpkg etc.)

If that fails, you'll have to build it from source.

Mac OS-X

Coming soon...

Building and installing from source
-----------------------------------

To build and install this package, use the regular Python distutils
method::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

If you do not have a compiler available, you can use the
``--no-compiler`` build flag.  pyScore will still work, but will run
much slower::

  python setup.py build --no-compiler
  python setup.py install

On Mac OS-X, you probably want to install the scripts somewhere reasonable::

  python setup.py install --install-scripts=/usr/local/bin

Binary installers
-----------------

No binary installers available yet.

Acknowledgements
================

This package includes local copies of other third-party packages, so
that it can be installed on a vanilla Python system.  I'd like to
thank these Ã¼ber-programmers for their great work:
