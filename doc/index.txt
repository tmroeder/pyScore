pyScore is a set of Python-based tools for working with symbolic music
notation.

Since it is pure Python (with an optional compiled rational number
library), it runs on many different platforms without modifications,
including Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple Mac OS-X.

pyScore can be run from the commandline or as a Python library.  GUI
support *may* be available in the future if there is enough demand.
It should be fairly easy for an experienced Python GUI programmer to
build a GUI for pyScore.

This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation
through an Information Technology Research grant.

Features
========

The current features are:

- Guido_ normalization
- Extracting absolute times for Guido_ events
- Guido_ to MusicXML_ conversion
- MusicXML_ to Guido_ conversion
- MusicXML_ to MidiXML_ to MIDI_ conversion (at the moment this is
  very "literal", but works for many things)
- Obtaining rendered music images from the Guido_ Noteserver_ over an Internet connection.
- a set of test cases for authors of Guido_ and MusicXML_ tools

.. _Guido: http://www.salieri.org/guido/
.. _Noteserver: http://www.noteserver.org/
.. _MusicXML: http://www.musicxml.com/
.. _MidiXML: http://www.recordare.com/dtds/midixml.html
.. _MIDI: http://www.midi.org/

The various conversions are illustrated in the following graph.  Each
arrow represents a direct conversion.  The dashed arrows indicate that
the conversion is somehow lossy.  The bluish nodes represent
on-disk files.  Everything else is an in-memory data structure.

Test results
============

There are some automatically generated `test results`__ that
demonstrate the abilities of the system.  

It is not expected at this point that the output is entirely correct.
If you see a long URL displayed beginning with
``http://tempo.iti.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/``, that means the Guido
NoteServer choked on what was being sent to it, which is most likely
the result of pyScore generating erroneous output. Internet Explorer and
Mozilla will display the MusicXML files as pretty-printed XML which is
a nice way to debug the output.  If your browser is set up to play
MIDI files, they should play directly from the link.

Installation
============

Building and installing from source
-----------------------------------

To build and install this package, use the regular Python distutils
method::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

If you do not have a compiler available, you can use the
``--no-compiler`` build flag.  pyScore will still work, but will run
much slower::

  python setup.py build --no-compiler
  python setup.py install

On Mac OS-X, you probably want to install the scripts somewhere reasonable::

  python setup.py install --install-scripts=/usr/local/bin

Binary installers
-----------------

No binary installers available yet.

================

This package includes local copies of other third-party packages, so
that it can be installed on a vanilla Python system.  I'd like to

  copied and pasted the constants.  Thank you, Max M, for saving me a
  lot of typing.)
