pyScore

(c) 2004 Michael Droettboom

Various Python tools for working with symbolic music notation.

Currently, the only features are:

- Guido normalization
- Guido -> MusicXML conversion


To build and install this package, use the regular Python distutils
method:

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install


This package includes local copies of other third-party packages, so
that it can be installed on a vanilla Python system.  I'd like to
thank these uber-programmers for their great work:
