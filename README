Release Notes
=============

Pertaining to latest release (0.1):

Notes
-----

- Guido is output with latin_1 encoding, because that seems to work with NoteServer [convert.py]

- arguments to Guido beams are ignored [beam_stem.py]

- MusicXML doesn't seem to have a way to support Guido \\headsReverse [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Guido \\noteFormat tag is completely unsupported [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Guido \\splitChord tag is completely unsupported [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- In GUIDO, barlines are "global": i.e. they affect all parts.  Therefore, we merge all barlines, but warn if there are barlines in subsequent parts that do not match those in the previous parts. [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Cross-staff beaming doesn't seem to work [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Guido doesn't have named parts like MusicXML, so we grab it from the \\instrument tag [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Measures out-of-order in Guido are ignored [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- trills, turns and mordents are much less specific in MusicXML than in GUIDO, so pitch name (but not the accidental) of auxiliary notes are thrown out, as well as any duration for the ornament [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Slurs are not converted from MusicXML to Guido, since slurs can start in one voice and end in another.  (This is not supported by Guido). [musicxml_to_guido.py]

- Only the first verse of lyrics in MusicXML can be stored in Guido [musicxml_to_guido.py]

- There is no way to represent <senza-misura> and type="single-number" [musicxml_to_guido.py]

- Tempo names are not converted from MusicXML -> Guido, only metronome markings [musicxml_to_guido.py]

- There is a limited vocabulary of written directions that get converted from [musicxml_to_guido.py]

- Markings followed by dashes is not supported by MusicXML -> Guido [musicxml_to_guido.py]

Bugs or shortcomings in other systems
-------------------------------------

- Note-level dynamics do not seem to work in Turandot [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- tremolos don't seem to work in Turandot [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- secondary beaming doesn't seem to work in Turandot [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Elisions don't work correctly in Turandot. [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- ornaments don't seem to work in Turandot [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Turandot doesn't seem to handle changing clefs mid-stream [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- System breaks don't work in Turandot. [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- multiple repeat endings do not seem to work in Turandot [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- tempo tags don't seem to work in Turandot [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- Octave shift does not seem to work with Turandot [guido_to_musicxml.py]

To-dos
------

- add support for custom namespace resolvers/default namespaces [ElementTree.py]

- add support for incremental parsing [ElementTree.py]

- document GuidoToMusicXML.make_plan because it's really hairy [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- support word-based (as opposed to wedge-based) *cresc.* and *dim.* [guido_to_musicxml.py]

- deal with time-wise MusicXML scores (e.g. use Michael Good's XSLT transform first) [musicxml_to_guido.py]

- MusicXML -> Guido ornament handling [musicxml_to_guido.py]

- check that we have ``xmllint`` and use it [validate.py]

Longer-term plans
-----------------

- Finish support for conversion from MusicXML to Guido [musicxml_to_guido.py]

- Possibly switch to another XML toolkit to support transformation and validation directly from Python [validate.py]



Test results
============

There are some automatically generated `test results`__ that
demonstrate the abilities of the system.  

It is not expected at this point that the output is entirely correct.
If you see a long URL displayed beginning with
``http://tempo.iti.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/``, that means the Guido
NoteServer choked on what was being sent to it.  The XML is extremely
hard to read at the moment because I haven't got around to
pretty-printing it yet.

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need a copy of `libxml2/libxslt`__ with Python bindings
installed.

.. __: http://www.libxml.org

Microsoft Windows
`````````````````

Stéphane Bidoul maintains installers of the `libxml2/libxslt Python
bindings`__.  That's by far the easiest way to get this going on
Windows.

.. __: http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/

Linux
`````

To see if the libxml2/libxslt Python bindings are already installed,
open a Python interpreter and type::

  import libxml

If you don't receive an error, you're good to go.

If not, there's a good chance your distribution provides a binary package.
For instance, on Fedora Core 1.0, the package is named
``libxml2-python``.  Try installing it using your
distribution-specific package installation tool (RPM, dpkg etc.)

If that fails, you'll have to build it from source.

Mac OS-X
````````

Coming soon...

Building and installing from source
-----------------------------------

To build and install this package, use the regular Python distutils
method::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

If you do not have a compiler available, you can use the
``--no-compiler`` build flag.  pyScore will still work, but will run
much slower::

  python setup.py build --no-compiler
  python setup.py install

On Mac OS-X, you probably want to install the scripts somewhere reasonable::

  python setup.py install --install-scripts=/usr/local/bin

Binary installers
-----------------

No binary installers available yet.

Acknowledgements
================

This package includes local copies of other third-party packages, so
that it can be installed on a vanilla Python system.  I'd like to
